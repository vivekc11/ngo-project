Hand out ‘knowledge kits’ with resources, condoms, and helpful links at your workplace or school. Invite a speaker or show a short video for a lunchtime info session on a sexual health topic.

The European Commission is seeking proposals for its Operational Digital Platforms which aim to support EU environmental and energy targets, improve the competitiveness of the EU industry and address the ongoing energy crisis, by providing both technologies and connectivity … [Read more...] about Call for Proposals: Operational Digital Platforms","Deadline: 16-Oct-2025 The European Commission is seeking proposals for its Operational Digital Platforms which aim to support EU environmental and energy targets, improve the competitiveness of the EU industry and address the ongoing energy crisis, by providing both technologies and connectivity to enable a cyber-secure Internet of Energy and an optimized transport system along the major European paths. Objectives They are dedicated to “retro-fitting” the existing energy and/or transport infrastructures with the required cross-border digital infrastructure. ODPs will optimize energy use of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) and reduce the environmental impact, while increasing the benefits enabled by ICT. ODPs will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures, in particular those supported in other parts of the CEF Digital programme, the Digital Europe Programme, and the Horizon Europe programme. The ODPs will contribute to the achievement of EU technological sovereignty and to the security and resilience of energy supply and transports in the EU. This support contributes to the Digital Decade goals such as the deployment of 10,000 climate neutral highly secure edge nodes, etc. Scopes The projects supported by this call are expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure implementing an AI-Driven Operational Digital Platform (ODP) for Electricity Consumers and Integration of electric vehicles (EV), electric trucks (ET), renewable energy sources (RES) into the Grid. Moreover, the proposed platform could help data centres, which are among the fastest growing energy consumers in Europe, to shift non-critical workloads to times or locations where energy is greener or cheaper and participate in grid services, acting as flexible loads that can ramp up or down to support balancing. The platform must include the maximum number of the following key functionalities: Real-time monitoring and feedback for consumers on energy rate use, carbon footprint, and tariff optimisation; AI-based advisory services, helping users to adjust their behaviours or schedules to match renewable availability. Participation in virtual energy communities (VECs), allowing local prosumers to trade surplus energy or flexibility; Integration of controllable assets such as EV chargers, heat pumps, or batteries to provide demand response; AI-powered charging optimisation, based on traffic, weather, grid conditions, and fleet schedules; Dynamic pricing and congestion signals, ensuring grid-aware energy consumption and EV charging; Smart routing tools for logistics managers, integrating vehicle range, charging station status, and energy prices; Integration of renewable generation (e.g. solar, wind) into vehicle charging plans Support for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, where EVs can return energy to the grid during peak demand. Optional functionalities may include: Participation of data centres in flexibility markets, via dynamic load shifting or reserve services; Data centres workload migration tools, allowing computing tasks to be routed across borders to greener data centres. Funding Information The estimated available call budget is EUR 20 000 000. It is expected that one project will be supported. Projects should normally be up to 36 months (extensions are possible, if duly justified and through an amendment). Expected Impact The project is expected to deploy cross-border digital infrastructure that will accelerate the digitalisation of the energy/mobility sector by enhancing interoperability and standardisation and trigger a public-private partnership virtuous circle of investment. To the extent possible, this infrastructure will build on and integrate with existing and emerging European data, cloud and edge computing and connectivity infrastructures. The project should lead to a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) and improvement in the energy and environmental performance of the European energy, transport and digital infrastructures thus addressing and easing the current energy and climate crisis and avoiding blackouts. The key performance indicators for the topic will include the number of connected operators supporting cross-border exchange of data and services, the number of interconnected cross border energy and/or transport systems, the amount of energy saved and the percentage of GHG emission decrease due to cross-border energy and/or transport exchange, as well as the degree of integration with the European data, computing, and connectivity infrastructure both for leveraging digital infrastructure and optimising its energy and environmental performance. Eligible Projects Projects funded under this call should include specific deliverables, milestones and KPIs related to: Deploying fully functional, cross-border ODPs in line with the description in the scope section; Delivering quantifiable results in terms of CO₂ reduction, energy savings, and grid flexibility; Providing open, standards-based architectures suitable for replication in other Member States, also in line with the vision for an AI-enabled digital spine of the energy and e-mobility system and other EU initiatives; Strengthening collaboration across sectors (energy, transport, ICT) and across borders; Creating new business models for distributed energy resources, smart mobility, and sustainable infrastructure; Improving consumer empowerment, data transparency, and system efficiency.

This initiative aims to strengthen the socio-cultural and development impact of the Programme for Emergency Community Development (PUDC) by incorporating a strong social engineering component to ensure sustainability. As part of its work in the Casamance region, UNDP is implementing a Japan-funded project focused on helping former combatants and displaced persons reintegrate into newly cleared communities. The project emphasizes restoring basic services, building peace , and fostering social cohesion. To carry out this work, UNDP is seeking an experienced NGO or CSO to lead several targeted activities. These include collecting civil status non-registration certificates in the communes of Boutoupa Camaracounda and Oulampane, conducting awareness campaigns on social cohesion, and providing psychosocial support for conflict survivors in the same areas. Additionally, the organization will be responsible for organizing community roundtables in the regions of Kolda, Sédhiou, and Ziguinchor and delivering citizenship capacity-building sessions for youth in these regions. The reintegration project will deliver several tangible outcomes. It will help facilitate the official reintegration process by verifying documents and issuing non-registration certificates. It also aims to sensitize local communities to foster inclusion and non-discrimination and provide psychosocial care to support healing and resilience. The main objective of this call is to identify a civil society organization capable of implementing these interventions effectively. More specifically, the goal is to support sustainable reintegration through civil status documentation, peace awareness, and mental health support. The selected organization will also help measure the impact of the PUDC model and engage the population—especially youth and women—in the development process. The minimum funding available per grant is USD 55,000. This funding should cover a mix of direct interventions across communities and must align with the administrative and financial capacity of the applying organization. The expected duration of the project is no more than six months. Eligible activities must target the communes of Boutoupa and Oulampane and focus on returnees, youth, women , mayors, and private sector actors in Ziguinchor, Kolda, and Sédhiou. Organizations must be based in one of these three regions and demonstrate a strong track record in local development, gender-sensitive programming, and project implementation. Eligible organizations should have experience managing grants, effective communication systems, and the ability to submit a detailed, costed proposal. The budget should be divided into USD 20,000 for reintegration activities in the two communes and USD 35,000 for regional activities under the PUDC consolidation. Proposals will be evaluated on several criteria. These include the quality and innovation of the technical approach, direct impact on beneficiary needs, financial capacity, and mechanisms for participatory monitoring and evaluation to ensure long-term sustainability and community ownership.

The program is specifically designed to enhance the capacities of local, regional, and national civil society organizations in Poland, creating a supportive environment for civil society to thrive. Through this initiative, the aim is to strengthen the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and reinforce respect for democracy and the rule of law, ensuring that these principles are actively upheld at every level of society. This program is expected to yield multiple positive outcomes. It will significantly boost the potential of local civil society organizations by improving their ability to generate meaningful social change and influence public discourse. By increasing the operational and advocacy capacity of these organizations, especially in terms of monitoring, intervention, and promoting European values, the program will empower them to become more effective in their missions. It also places a strong emphasis on supporting disadvantaged groups, such as individuals with special needs, minorities, women, and seniors, ensuring that the principle of inclusion is central to the program’s activities. Additionally, the partner organizations within the SPLOT Network will benefit from enhanced knowledge and the adoption of innovative tools and methods to better implement their statutory goals. With a total project value exceeding 6.6 million euros and direct funding support amounting to nearly 6 million euros, the initiative plans to implement a wide range of activities to meet its objectives. A primary focus is building the capacity of 920 non-governmental organizations across the country to safeguard EU values and fundamental rights. The program will also promote broader public awareness about the critical role that democratic values play in sustaining civil society, encouraging organizations to become more vocal and active participants in shaping laws and policies. A nationwide information and education campaign will be launched to deliver trustworthy and accurate content on the foundational principles of the European Union, aiming to foster a deeper understanding and appreciation among the public. To support this work, financial grants will be made available to between 220 and 230 non-governmental organizations. These grants will enable organizations to scale up their efforts, expand their reach, and engage in meaningful, values-driven programming. The target group for this initiative consists of Polish civil society organizations, particularly those operating in local and regional contexts with limited resources. Organizations based in rural areas will receive special attention to ensure equitable participation and representation. The SPLOT Values Program also seeks to uplift leaders, activists, and individuals committed to social engagement. By enhancing their understanding of EU values and showcasing best practices at both the European and national levels, the initiative will help them build the skills and knowledge necessary for impactful advocacy. Ultimately, the program aims to cultivate a more vibrant, resilient, and democratic civil society in Poland, grounded in the shared values of the European Union.

The Foundation seeks to empower organizations that align with its core mission: to use sport, and particularly football, as a powerful tool for development and positive social impact. This initiative is open to NGOs and other organizations committed to making a real difference in the lives of children . Applications are welcomed from projects that promote children’s rights in a variety of key focus areas. These include ensuring children have access to sport and opportunities for personal development , supporting children with disabilities, promoting healthy lifestyles, and assisting those who are victims of conflict. Projects advancing gender equality, environmental protection, employability, and improved infrastructure and equipment are also encouraged. Strengthening partnerships to maximize impact is another area of focus. To be eligible, organizations must meet a set of strict deal-breaker criteria. They must have a legal identity and be recognized by institutional partners or have been registered for at least three years. Organizations that fail to provide approved financial reports for the past three years or that do not uphold the foundation’s ethics code will be disqualified. From a project perspective, initiatives must involve a majority of children under the age of 18 and include at least 20% girls. Projects that focus solely on scouting or developing young talent for professional purposes are not eligible. In addition to these compulsory requirements, there are weighted criteria that help the Foundation assess the overall value of each project. Institutional factors include the organization’s level of administrative costs and the extent of co-funding. Project-specific factors include the number and age range of children served, the participation rate of girls, and the integration of gender equality principles. Other factors that can improve a project’s chances include the inclusion of sports activities, environmental impact, sensitivity to local socio-economic conditions, and alignment with real community needs. The Foundation also considers whether the project collaborates with institutional partners and how sustainable the activities are in the medium and long term. Inclusion of local minorities and people of all abilities is also a positive indicator. The UEFA Foundation for Children continues to champion initiatives that provide meaningful, inclusive, and sustainable change for children in need. By supporting projects that go beyond temporary aid and work toward long-term development, the Foundation remains committed to ensuring a better and more equal future for children everywhere.

Aims The initiative aims to strengthen local and national circular economy framework and practices by supporting plastic waste recovery and recycling through SME business models. Objectives The project seeks to transform plastic waste into an economic opportunity by empowering small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in plastic recycling to adopt sustainable and circular practices. It aligns with UNEP’s Medium-Term Strategy 2022–2025 and SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production, as well as Pakistan’s commitment under its national plastic action agenda and circular economy roadmap. The current call for proposals aims to identify and support local not-for-profit implementing partners who can facilitate pilot interventions that enhance the capacity and performance of plastic recycling SMEs. These pilots are intended to promote inclusive and climate-responsive plastic waste management solutions by: Demonstrating scalable and locally adaptable recycling systems; Fostering collaboration among municipal authorities, private recyclers, and communities; Encouraging technological innovation and business model improvements; and Enabling supportive policy environments that formalize and integrate informal actors. Project Description The project “From Waste to Wealth: SME-led Plastic Recycling for a Circular Economy in Pakistan – Pilot Implementation at Local Levels” seeks to operationalize a city-level plastic recycling model that is led by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and tailored to the local context. Building on the feasibility study completed in FY2024, which mapped the plastic recycling landscape and assessed SME capacities, the current phase aims to implement and test a practical and scalable model in a municipality proposed by the selected implementing partner. The proposal must justify the chosen location based on local needs, institutional readiness, and engagement with relevant stakeholders. The implementation will be structured around four sequential and interconnected components. The first component involves conducting a detailed baseline assessment in the selected city or municipality. This includes analyzing existing plastic waste streams, identifying the current SME landscape and their operational bottlenecks, and mapping key stakeholders including municipal authorities, informal sector workers, and community groups. The partner is expected to establish a local coordination mechanism to facilitate smooth engagement with these actors. The output of this stage will be a baseline report that reflects the local context, data-driven priorities, and a stakeholder coordination strategy. The second component focuses on customizing the SME-led business model and preparing the technical and financial groundwork for pilot operations. Using insights from the baseline assessment, the partner will identify two to three SMEs that are suitable for piloting. The selected SMEs should be formally registered, active in the recycling sector, and demonstrate readiness to participate in the pilot. The implementing partner will develop detailed business and technical plans tailored to each SME’s needs, covering operational workflows, infrastructure requirements, product-market alignment, and financial viability. This planning stage will also include a risk assessment and mitigation strategy. The third component transitions from planning to action, whereby the selected SMEs will be supported through a coordinated pilot rollout. The implementing partner will provide hands-on technical assistance, training on material handling and sorting, and support in accessing basic resources necessary to operationalize recycling activities. Regular monitoring will be conducted to track the performance of SMEs and ensure alignment with the proposed business models. The implementing partner is expected to document implementation processes, collect performance data, and submit an interim report detailing the progress, challenges encountered, and preliminary outcomes. The final component of the project centers on evaluating the pilot’s overall impact and planning for replication. The implementing partner will conduct a comprehensive evaluation to measure the pilot’s effectiveness across technical, financial, environmental, and social dimensions. This evaluation will feed into the development of a final report that captures lessons learned, success factors, and potential improvements. In addition, the partner will be responsible for producing a knowledge product — such as a policy brief, case study, or implementation guide — that can be disseminated to local and national stakeholders, as well as international development partners. A final presentation summarizing results and recommendations will also be expected to support donor reporting and future scaling discussions. Throughout the project, the partner will be required to submit output-based financial and narrative reports according to UNEP’s Small-Scale Funding Agreement (SSFA) requirements. The partner must also adhere to UNEP’s communication and visibility standards and participate in regular review meetings with UNEP-IETC and its collaborating organizations, including the IGES-CCET team. All deliverables must be completed within the implementation period, ensuring a strong emphasis on efficiency, transparency, and impact. Eligibility Criteria To be eligible for consideration, the applicant must be a legally registered not-for-profit organization with a demonstrable track record of implementing projects in areas related to plastic waste management, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, circular economy, or sustainable livelihoods in urban settings. The organization should have at least three years of verifiable operational experience in Pakistan or similar developing country contexts and be able to show technical competence in community-based project implementation, environmental sustainability, and/or value chain development. Applicants must demonstrate their ability to coordinate effectively with municipal authorities, relevant national agencies, private sector actors, and informal sector stakeholders. Prior experience in working with SMEs, cooperatives, or informal workers involved in the recycling or waste sector will be viewed as a significant asset. The ability to navigate multi-stakeholder environments and secure buy-in from local actors will be critical for successful project execution. The organization should possess sound financial and administrative management systems that comply with international standards and UNEP’s due diligence requirements. This includes having transparent accounting procedures, adequate internal controls, and the ability to manage and report on grant-based funding in a timely and accurate manner. As part of the application package, interested entities must submit a comprehensive technical proposal. The proposal should clearly articulate the rationale for selecting the proposed pilot location, describe the local context, and present a feasible implementation strategy that aligns with the four core activities of the project. In addition, the proposal must include a detailed workplan, a timeline of activities, a stakeholder engagement approach, risk mitigation measures, and a realistic budget aligned with output-based financing. Evidence of institutional capacity, prior project results, and staffing plans should also be included.

UNDP is looking for vendors to develop an e-learning platform to enhance the capacity of CSS-HR program implementers at all levels. This online learning media for Principal Recipients Indonesia AIDS Coalition (PR IAC) will consist of several learning courses on human rights and gender. The platform developed is web-based and can be accessed via digital devices (desktop computers, laptops, or smartphones) online and offline. It uses a Digital Platform in the form of an LMS (Learning Management System) that contains animated content (videos or recordings, visual materials, and infographics). Then, the learning course developed needs to use an assessment and graduation system. The initiative provides support to 20 countries including Indonesia to scale up to comprehensive levels of programs to remove human rights-related barriers to HIV . According to its theory of change, human rights-related barriers increase the vulnerability of people to HIV infection and hinder the access to, uptake of, and retention of HIV services, in particular to certain vulnerable and key populations. To reduce those barriers effectively, countries must implement evidence-based, globally recognized, human rights and gender-related interventions. Actions taken to eliminate obstacles associated with rights will additionally safeguard and improve investments made by the Global Fund, as well as fortify health and community systems. Through online learning courses, it is targeted that staff can increase their knowledge and capacity in identifying barriers related to gender and human rights and be able to design and implement relevant strategies. Therefore, PR IAC can ensure that all staff involved have the minimum standard of knowledge required to carry out their respective roles to achieve these targets. The e-learning content needs to be SCORM-compliant or compatible with other learning systems. Platform host all content internally, hosted on IAC’s existing server infrastructure, can storage data/information (i.e. participants who have accessed and submitted; or certificates of graduation that can be downloaded multiple time) and has data privacy standard (i.e. post-test results and anyone who has passed learning, except senior management). Direct contributions of developing an e-learning platform are: Strengthens capacity of program implementers from national to sub national level regarding human rights and gender program, and the new paralegal and advocacy field officers to apply human rights and gender approaches in their work. Provides standardized training to new staff across 38 districts. Responds to Global Fund recommendations for renewed funding to build capacity of implementers on human rights and gender and establish clear documentation guidelines. This demonstrates commitment to strengthening program impact. Objectives To develop a platform that can be used as an online learning medium for Principal Recipients Indonesia AIDS Coalition (PR IAC). This platform will consist of several learning courses regarding human rights and gender in the form of: Massive, open, online course learning (but allow for offline content download), independent (not facilitated by trainers) Using a Digital Platform in the form of LMS (Learning Management System) Videos (animations and/or recordings), visual materials, and infographics Can be done anytime and anywhere, individually Using an assessment and graduation system Topics Syllabus human rights include: Basic Human Rights: Social context and analysis: Understanding context mapping/social analysis, the importance of social analysis of human rights and its examples How to conduct context mapping or social analysis Basic Concepts, Definitions and History of Human Rights: Understanding the basic concepts of human rights The relationship between the concept of human rights and the context of the rights of people with HIV and key populations Advanced Human Rights: Understanding the Concept of State Obligations and Human Rights Violations: The Concept of State Obligations in Human Rights Law Human Rights Violations and Forms of Human Rights Violations Recognizing the Basic Human Rights Instruments at the National Level: Types of basic human rights instruments at the national level Scope of the contents of the Constitutional Amendment on Human Rights State Obligations CSS HR (Community and Human Rights System Strengthening): CSS HR foundations: Community Systems Strengthening Framework CSS core components Community Led Monitoring (CLM): CLM core principles routine data collection and analysis Syllabus gender include: Basic gender: The concept of gender: Concept of gender and sex Gender spectrum known in society Gender inequality: Understanding and Concept of Gender Injustice in General Forms of Gender Injustice Advanced gender: Gender Based Violence (GBV) and HIV: Definition, root causes and forms of GBV GBV and HIV GBV as a vulnerability factor for HIV infection: The relationship between GBV and HIV risk Case examples of GBV in HIV infection vulnerability Expected Outcomes Establishment of e-learning platform (web based) for human rights and gender. Increased knowledge of human rights and gender concepts among implementers. Improved skills in applying human rights-based and gender-transformative approaches.

If there is no named organisation, this will need to be in place before your application can progress to full assessment. Have at least one set of annual accounts filed with Companies House that show a track record of frontline delivery. You must also have filed your CIC Annual Report CIC34 for the last year. They will ask you to submit your profit and loss account for your latest financial year. Have at least three unrelated Directors sitting on your Board who are registered with Companies House.

Most of your organisation’s time and money is spent on activities in England, Wales and/or the Isle of Man helping people living in these areas.

This is total income and, in the case of consolidated accounts, should cover all entities within those accounts. Have a bank account in the name of the organisation with unrelated signatories. If the application is successful, the grant must be paid into this account. The majority of people in positions of power (including directors/trustees, the CEO and senior managers) must not be related nor live at the same address. Where there are related parties, they will consider the relationship, conflicts of interest and loyalty, the balance of power of the related directors/trustees, and how this is managed. Have a track record of delivering support, activity or services, for at least one year, to people aged 18 and over. You must currently be delivering these services. If your organisation has recently merged, then this must apply to at least one organisation pre-merger.

They will explore what safeguarding means to your organisation, how it fits with your mission and values, and your approach to safeguarding across your organisation. Have a Designated Safeguarding Lead/ Officer (DSL/O). This person will be accountable for your safeguarding practice and will be appropriately trained. In most cases they expect the DSL/O to have undertaken “Designated Safeguarding Lead training” This may be called as such or may be called Level 3 training in England or Level C training in Wales. Hold Public Liability Insurance. Be an independent organisation. They will look at any formal associations you have with other organisations, parent bodies, or group structures. They will check that the Board or Directors of the applicant organisation has full control over its work and any conflicts of interest. If you have a live grant with Lloyds Bank Foundation, it must end before 31 December 2026. You must meet these programme criteria to be considered for funding. Your organisation will be led by and working for Deaf and Disabled people. By this, they mean that a majority (at least 51%) of your Directors/Trustees and half (at least 50%) of staff, at all levels of your organisation, self-identify as Deaf and/or Disabled people. They will prioritise funding organisations where at least 75% of your Directors/Trustees and 50% of staff self-identify as Deaf and/or Disabled people. The support, activities or services you deliver must be person centred and supporting people over the long term. Your charity will support Deaf and Disabled people over the longer term to support them to have more choice and control over their lives, access their rights and entitlements and challenge the barriers they face. Your organisation may have a main focus, such as providing advice and advocacy, reducing isolation or delivering employability support, but you will tailor what you do to meet the needs of the individual. For the needs of people that you can’t meet directly, you will have trusted relationships in place with other organisations or agencies to which you refer people. Ineligibility Criteria They do not provide funding for the following organisations: Organisations that are not charities or Community Interest Companies registered in England and Wales. Infrastructure or ‘umbrella’ organisations. Organisations whose primary purpose is to give funds to individuals or other organisations.

This initiative is designed to support community-led projects that improve the natural environment and help people connect with and enjoy nature in their local areas. The fund is particularly focused on projects that protect nature while engaging communities to take part in caring for their surroundings. Projects that are eligible for funding must align with one or both of the following aims: helping people connect with and care for nature in their area, or making a positive impact on the environment . The grants range from £300 to £20,000 , and projects can run for up to two years . The funding can be used to start new activities, continue existing ones, adapt to new challenges, or organize one-off events that provide a clear environmental benefit. However, there are certain activities and projects that are not eligible for funding. For instance, school-based projects that primarily benefit pupils, such as outdoor classrooms or sensory gardens with limited public access, will not be funded. Similarly, garden makeovers by students as part of a course, or one-off festivals that include a sustainability theme but lack core environmental activities, are not considered suitable for this grant. Eligible projects must go beyond individual or educational benefits to offer a broader community impact. Examples of projects that will not be funded include installing solar panels at a private sports venue that is not widely accessible, international educational competitions with no local impact, or in-school environmental lessons that replicate existing curriculum content without added community value. Organizations eligible to apply include constituted voluntary or community groups , registered charities , charitable incorporated organizations (CIOs) , not-for-profit companies , community interest companies (CICs) , community benefit societies , and statutory bodies such as town or parish councils. Schools may also apply, provided their project serves the wider community and not just the school itself. Applications from individuals, sole traders, or organizations based outside the UK are not accepted. For-profit companies, including Companies Limited by Shares, are also ineligible. Furthermore, organizations that already have an active Awards for All grant, have received £20,000 from the program in the past 12 months, or are awaiting a decision on another application are not eligible. Applications submitted through private businesses or consultants will not be considered. This funding opportunity encourages grassroots environmental initiatives with a clear community focus, aiming to foster long-term relationships between people and nature.

This initiative is designed to fund innovative organizations in the early phases of their development that are working to close gaps in the field of gender equity. The foundation is particularly interested in organizations that apply a gender lens across their work, either in the U.S. Jewish community or in Israel . Through the Spark Grant Program, the foundation seeks to invest in timely and forward-thinking ventures that tackle urgent challenges facing women and girls. These grants are intended to support initiatives that not only address immediate needs but also contribute to long-term, systemic change by focusing on the unique perspectives and experiences of women and girls. For the upcoming funding cycle, the foundation plans to award four Spark Grants of $20,000 each. This 18-month grant period will begin in February 2026 and conclude in July 2027. Recipients will receive the funding in two installments: $10,000 at the beginning of the grant and an additional $10,000 one year into the cycle. Eligible applicants must be nonprofit organizations based in either the United States or Israel and must have tax-exempt status or a fiscal sponsor with 501(c)(3) status. To qualify, organizations should either have an annual budget of $500,000 or less or have been in existence for ten years or fewer. The Hadassah Foundation welcomes proposals from groups that work within the U.S. Jewish community or are located in Israel. Successful applicants will demonstrate how they integrate gender awareness into their programs by acknowledging how gender shapes needs, impacts outcomes, and perpetuates societal norms. Whether working in gender-specific or multigender environments, applicants should present key initiatives that enhance the lives and status of women and girls. Additionally, the foundation is looking for organizations that are driving social change by confronting the root causes of inequality and those that offer innovative approaches to emerging issues that disproportionately affect women and girls.

The fund will place more emphasis on equitable working, supporting wellbeing and legacy planning. They now offer core grants to single museum organisations for strategic development of their inclusive collections work; and partnership project grants for museums and community organisations working equitably with collections to achieve shared aims for inclusion. Purpose The Esmée Fairbairn Communities and Collections Fund supports work with museum collections to improve inclusion and equitable working with community partners. They offer: Core grants to museums that have established strategic aims for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI); and that are ready to use their collections and their funding to support social and climate justice, in ways that are relevant to local contexts and relationships. Partnership project grants to museums and community organisations that work equitably together and share aims for DEI; with ambitious and compelling ideas for inclusive project work with collections. Funding Information Grants of up to £100k over a maximum of three years are available and they expect to award around 12 grants per year in two funding rounds. Grants of £40,000-£100,000 over a period of up to three years. Eligibility Criteria Essential Requirements: To be considered for a core grant, applications from single organisations must: Be for work that accelerates progress towards the established strategic aims of the applicant in relation to diversity, equity and inclusion. Applicants will describe their local context and existing relationships with community and stakeholder groups and provide evidence of strategies and plans for inclusion. Work with existing collections to engage community groups, partners and/or stakeholders in prominent, democratised and/or community-led roles. To be considered for a partnership project grant, applications must: Come from an equitable partnership between museum(s) and community organisation(s) that have developed the application together and that have an existing relationship on which to build. Be for a time-limited project working with existing collections towards shared aims for diversity, equity and inclusion. The Esmée Fairbairn Communities and Collections Fund is open to all MA institutional member museums and galleries in the United Kingdom for core or partnership grants. MA membership is required to demonstrate commitment to sharing learning, to the social and climate justice agenda of Museums Change Lives, and to the museum sector’s Code of Ethics. Partnership applications must include at least one MA institutional member museum partner. It is expected that the museum partner(s) will hold collections that will be used during the partnership project and that a museum partner is typically well positioned to receive and coordinate funding on behalf of the group. They normally expect museum applicants, or one applicant in a partnership, to be Accredited (or formally working towards this). Occasional exceptions may be made where the applicant’s activities are based on the care and interpretation of collections of historical, artistic or scientific interest, provided that they are in the public sector or have charitable status. The selection committee’s decision on eligibility is final. For core grants, they expect to fund smaller and medium sized museums where funding of this size can make the most long-term difference, for example as a higher proportion of turnover. National and larger museums may apply, but they expect applications to reflect their capacity to influence the sector more widely and to develop museum practice. National and larger museums are strongly advised to speak to staff at the MA prior to applying. Applicants must have an up-to-date safeguarding policy to protect people with whom they work. Exclusions The Esmée Fairbairn Communities and Collections Fund will not support: Capital costs, including building work, renovations, and equipment. Grants to individuals or to causes that will benefit only one person, including student grants or bursaries. Work that does not have a direct benefit in the UK. They will not normally replace or subsidise statutory income although they will make rare exceptions where the level of performance has been exceptional and where the potential impact of the work is substantial. The promotion of religion . Retrospective funding, meaning support for work that has already taken place. General appeals or circulars. Assessment Criteria All applications are assessed for: A strong link between the people you wish to work with, the collections you expect to use and the topics or themes that you will explore. Progress towards leading participatory practice and/or equitable working. The beneficial impact on your organisation(s) and individuals within it, and, where appropriate, the wider museums sector, or partners from other sectors. The ambition, innovation , creativity and/or approach to risk of the work, in the context of your museum/partnership. Feasibility within the headline budget and timescale; and value for money. How you will manage the end of the funding period and sustain or build on the benefits of funding.

This initiative aims to foster active citizenship that leads to equitable, inclusive, sustainable, and value-driven development. The goal is to empower CSOs to play a meaningful role in shaping development strategies and outcomes across local communities. One of the main objectives of this call is to strengthen the capacity of CSOs to lead participatory planning and development processes. These organisations are expected to engage in multi-stakeholder policy dialogues involving local communities, authorities, and the private sector. The initiative also focuses on enabling CSOs and local communities to contribute effectively to the just transition, including sustainable economic development, transparency, and accountability. The programme aims to enhance the ability of CSOs to support environmental protection, CO2 emission reduction, and green transition efforts under the EU’s Global Gateway strategy. This includes raising awareness, driving community participation, and contributing to policy design and implementation. Priority will be given to actions that build understanding of the Global Gateway Investment Package and its impact on sectors like energy, transport, digital transformation, and pharmaceuticals. Projects that help communities dependent on unsustainable resources to shift toward greener economic models are also encouraged. Additional priorities include youth and women’s entrepreneurship, climate awareness, biodiversity management, citizen participation, and digital innovation . The total funding available under this call is EUR 3.625 million, with individual grants ranging from EUR 500,000 to EUR 1,000,000. However, the European Commission reserves the right not to allocate the full budget. Some actions are not eligible for funding. These include projects focused solely on individual sponsorships or scholarships, actions that may violate human rights or environmental safeguards, and those supporting political or religious agendas. Projects primarily involving equipment procurement are also ineligible. In terms of costs, any expenses that do not align with the contract conditions will be deemed ineligible. This includes debt service charges, previously financed expenses, purchases of land or property, in-kind contributions (except for volunteer work), and financial bonuses. Eligibility for this grant involves several layers. The lead applicant must be a legal, non-profit entity such as an NGO, local authority, or public sector operator. They must be based in South Africa, an EU Member State, or another eligible country. However, if the lead applicant is not based in South Africa, at least one South African co-applicant is required. The lead applicant must also be directly involved in managing the proposed project. Co-applicants are expected to share responsibility for project design and execution and must meet the same eligibility requirements as the lead applicant.

This initiative, part of the Zero Waste Grant Programme (ZWGP), seeks to support practical, innovative projects led by local actors working toward national zero waste targets. The ZWGP is open to a broad range of stakeholders, including local governments, civil society organizations, universities, research institutes, and industrial zones. The focus is on fostering collaboration among these groups to implement waste reduction measures aligned with Türkiye’s national zero waste policy. The overall goal of this call is to improve waste management in Türkiye. Specifically, it aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the volume of waste by building capacity at the municipal level and increasing public awareness. The priorities include strengthening local authorities’ infrastructure, enhancing intersectoral cooperation, developing decision-making tools, and promoting public education on sustainable consumption and waste prevention. A total of EUR 6.3 million is available for this call. Grants must fall between EUR 500,000 and EUR 750,000. Actions may include setting up recycling centers or composting sites, promoting reuse and repair culture, integrating zero waste into local planning, and piloting innovative waste technologies. Public campaigns, school programs, food waste reduction, and town twinning activities between Türkiye and EU municipalities are also encouraged. However, certain activities are not eligible. These include projects focused only on conferences or scholarships, one-off events without a broader impact, academic research with no implementation, actions supporting political parties, or any initiative that results in environmental harm. Costs such as debt repayment, real estate purchases, taxes, and depreciation are also ineligible. Applicants must meet specific eligibility criteria. The lead applicant must be a legal, non-profit entity such as a municipality, special provincial administration, or solid waste management union established in Türkiye or an EU Member State. Co-applicants can include associations, universities, development agencies, cooperatives, professional chambers, and local authority unions. All applicants must play a direct role in preparing and managing the project. Entities that merely cooperate informally or have signed consortium agreements, subcontractors, and those receiving direct financial aid from the applicant are not considered affiliated and cannot be treated as part of the application.

This requires an integrated approach that addresses various dimensions such as climate protection, climate change adaptation, the circular economy, sustainable energy supply, sustainable mobility, biodiversity and soil protection, resource conservation and high-quality building culture, green finance, socially inclusive transformation processes, and the strengthening of regional economies. The Pioneer City Partnership for Sustainable Small and Medium-Sized Towns call for proposals is part of the joint mission “Climate-Neutral City” in cooperation with the Federal Ministry for Innovation , Mobility and Infrastructure (BMIMI). This call for proposals aims to provide a research impetus to build up additional resources, capacities and know-how in ambitious small and medium-sized towns and to promote knowledge exchange. Pioneer cities in the partnership must be committed to significantly increasing and accelerating their efforts to achieve climate neutrality, climate change adaptation, and a circular economy – based on an integrated approach. It is important that the level of ambition is significantly higher than the status quo and can serve as a model for other cities and municipalities. Objectives Establishment of partnerships with Austrian small and medium-sized towns (10,000 to 50,000 inhabitants) and joint participation in the national mission “Climate-Neutral City” Acceleration of implementation projects through impulses from the RTI through the integration of different various dimensions (climate neutrality, climate change adaptation, circular economy, etc.) Identify and initiate system adaptation needs to achieve climate neutrality Establish new formats and processes for knowledge building and collaborative learning Goals To promote implementation in the areas of climate protection, climate change adaptation and the circular economy to achieve system transformations. Effective capacities must be built up and embedded in structures. This requires close Coordination and consistent, decisive action between the political and administrative levels of a city. Urban administrative structures must be further developed to ensure that climate neutrality, climate change adaptation, and the circular economy are integrated into a city’s decision-making processes. A shared learning and transfer process must be initiated and enabled through stakeholder processes, collaborations, exchanges with other cities, the federal states, the Climate and Energy Fund, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and other relevant stakeholders. Cooperation networks, alliances, and participation in programs (KEM, KLAR, LEADER, e5, etc.) must be established and maintained. Pioneer cities serve as learning and experimentation spaces for innovations and solutions, which can then be used for other contexts and cities should be replicable, transferable and scalable. Innovation activities are incorporated into municipal action and decision-making practices, valued there and strengthen the competitiveness of the regional economy. The implementation projects are based on various (innovative) financing instruments and models. The aim is to make the best possible use of the national and international funding landscape, thus enabling additional funding and the launch of complementary initiatives. This should subsequently activate public and private sector investments (including from the private sector) and contribute to the development of climate-neutral cities. Target group-oriented communication and public relations work for sustainable cities must be carried out and supplemented by participatory processes that enable the active involvement of citizens. Funding Information Total Budget: Around 3.6 million euros. Financing is provided in the form of a financial transfer and amounts to a maximum of 500,000 euros per project. Eligible Costs Personnel costs Material costs (e.g. office rent, infrastructure, printing costs) Third-party costs personnel-related third-party costs (e.g. personnel from outsourced organizational units) other third-party costs limited to a maximum of 20% of the total costs (e.g. orders for support in Events) Travel expenses (e.g. hotel costs, travel expenses) Ineligible Costs Investment costs for projects Overhead costs Ambition levels and SDGs Ambition 1: Research and implementation The aim of Ambition 1 is to create a central contact point in the city administration through targeted capacity building that initiates, supports and carries out research and implementation projects in order to accelerate climate neutrality, climate change adaptation and the circular economy in the city. These projects should build on the climate neutrality roadmap already developed or comparable strategic preparatory work and consistently implement the measures defined therein. Ambition 2: Governance The aim is to establish climate neutrality, climate change adaptation and the circular economy as cross-cutting themes in urban (and urban-regional) governance and to effectively anchor them in all relevant areas – decisions, strategies, processes, measures and structures through innovative approaches. Responsibilities and the municipal organizational structure are to be further developed through administrative innovations within the framework of the cooperation. As part of the partnership, the responsible persons must identify and analyze within their municipal structures (governance) which regulations and processes require revision, adaptation, or redesign. The aim is to identify and eliminate barriers and obstacles on the path to achieving climate neutrality, climate change adaptation, and a circular economy, and to utilize existing and emerging potential. Ambition 3: Learning environment The goal is to consistently embed climate neutrality, climate change adaptation, and the circular economy in cities and establish them as a national and international learning environment for cities, municipalities, federal states, and the federal government. Pioneer cities should serve as role models, providing practical insights, data, and good practice examples, thus specifically supporting knowledge transfer, training, and implementation in other cities and regions. Eligibility Criteria This call for proposals is aimed at Austrian cities with between 10,000 and 50,000 inhabitants and is intended to conclude a cooperation agreement. Participation from cities that have already completed preparatory work, such as developing a climate neutrality roadmap, is particularly welcome. Cities with existing cooperation agreements are not eligible to apply.

As the UN’s leading agency in the fight against global hunger, WFP provides food assistance during emergencies and collaborates with communities to improve nutrition and build long-term household resilience. In Malawi, WFP is focused on breaking the cycle of hunger across generations and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable populations. The organization’s efforts aim to promote self-reliance and progress toward zero hunger. Under the first strategic outcome of its Country Strategic Plan (CSP), WFP will deliver life-saving food assistance—through both in-kind support and cash-based transfers (CBTs)—to the most vulnerable and acutely food-insecure individuals, especially those affected by shocks. The support will prioritize equitable access to food and nutrition among women, men, girls, boys, and those suffering from acute malnutrition, thereby contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The intervention will focus on food security and nutrition, including both direct food assistance and cash assistance, as well as the prevention and treatment of malnutrition. Selected Cooperating Partners will be responsible for managing all district and community engagement activities, including meetings with District Executive Committees (DECs), Area Development Committees (ADCs), and Village Development Committees (VDCs). Partners must conduct transparent and inclusive processes for beneficiary targeting and registration, completing these within three to four weeks. Accurate and up-to-date lists of beneficiaries must be submitted to WFP in line with agreed schedules. Timely and efficient delivery of assistance is critical. Cooperating Partners are expected to ensure that food or cash-based transfers reach the intended recipients as per the agreed distribution plans and timelines, while strictly adhering to WFP’s standard operating procedures for lean season assistance. In terms of accountability, functional complaints and feedback mechanisms (CFMs) must be established at all Final Distribution Points (FDPs), and regular community sensitization sessions should be conducted to encourage informed and active participation. Monitoring and reporting responsibilities include the submission of weekly and monthly progress reports detailing the number of beneficiaries reached (disaggregated by age and gender), transfer data, challenges faced, and any mitigation strategies employed. All assistance must be delivered in line with core humanitarian principles—neutrality, impartiality, independence, and humanity. Additionally, proper documentation of the entire implementation process is required, including beneficiary records, distribution documentation, and verification forms. A final report summarizing the implementation must also be submitted. This opportunity is targeted at organizations operating in Malawi’s Southern Region, which is the geographical focus for this round of lean season response activities.

This program is designed to support efforts that foster youth development, improve living standards—particularly for vulnerable populations—and introduce innovative tools that empower local communities to implement meaningful social and environmental change. The core goal of the initiative is to identify and back projects that have the potential to positively impact youth, strengthen the quality of life within communities, and improve environmental conditions in participating countries. In doing so, the program seeks to catalyze the emergence of new strategies for social innovation and deepen collaboration with local non-profit organizations (NPOs), community leaders, and civil society actors. By investing in initiatives with grassroots engagement, the program also aims to strengthen civil society and build lasting partnerships across sectors. The objectives of this effort are rooted in encouraging the creation and implementation of new solutions that address pressing social and environmental challenges. It aims to support the growth and sustainability of NPOs and youth movements that have been operational for at least two years in the eligible countries.

Food systems around the world are a significant contributor to super pollutant emissions while also being severely impacted by climate change and air pollution. At every stage of food production and consumption—from farms to tables to waste bins—harmful emissions such as black carbon, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are released. These pollutants not only degrade air quality and contribute to climate instability but also harm plant health, agricultural productivity, and human well-being. Tropospheric ozone alone is responsible for the annual loss of up to 121 million tonnes of crops globally. Through its Food & Nutrition Challenge, CCAC is looking for proposals that address several core focus areas using a cross-sector approach. One area involves strengthening natural nutrient and material cycles by diverting organic waste into more beneficial uses like gardening, bio-based products, or agricultural applications. These initiatives should enhance resilience through improved urban and rural planning, infrastructure, logistics, financial systems, and trade mechanisms, while respecting local customs and contexts. Another priority is the advancement of agroecological practices that improve soil health, biodiversity, and food security . This includes techniques such as applying compost or digestate at scale, promoting crop diversification and intercropping, agroforestry, and integrating crops with livestock for holistic benefits. The Coalition also supports efforts to expand sustainable cold-chain infrastructure throughout the food supply chain. This includes developing inclusive, energy-efficient refrigeration systems that use low or ultra-low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants to significantly reduce food loss. Enhancing access to cold storage and “first mile” transport infrastructure for farmers is an important part of this effort. Reducing edible food waste and improving systems for redistributing consumable food is another area of focus. These proposals should align with the COP29 Declaration on Reducing Methane from Organic Waste and target investments and infrastructure development at the local level. Additionally, the CCAC aims to support the establishment of transparent and accountable financial systems that accurately track greenhouse gas and super pollutant emission reductions. Projects should present measurable indicators and methodologies that demonstrate broader impacts and the potential for replication. Each selected project will be funded up to an estimated cost of $2,000,000. Only non-profit organizations, including NGOs, IGOs, and government bodies, are eligible for funding. While for-profit entities cannot receive funding directly from the CCAC, they can play an active role in the project as collaborators or co-implementers if their participation is essential to achieving project outcomes. Proposals must meet certain requirements to be considered: they should be complete, timely, relevant to the call, within the specified budget, and under 24 months in duration. All projects must also adhere to CCAC’s gender criteria.

In doing so, this project builds Tajikistans capability to interdict terrorist activity and movement through early detection, responding to terrorist activity at the source to protect Americas borders and security. Tajikistan is a critical counterterrorism nexus in Central Asia, a region ISIS-K seeks to exploit for recruitment and illicit cross-border activities. Despite vulnerabilities caused by Tajikistans remote and rugged borders, which create risks of illicit movement, it appears the greatest terrorist risk to the region and U.S. security lies in the potential of terrorist groups to inspire, recruit, and organize Central Asians to commit attacks. Goals Applicable CT Functional Bureau Strategy Goal(s): Goal 1: Terrorist plots and terrorist movements are disrupted. FBS Objective 1.2: Increase information sharing and joint planning with key partners through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms to anticipate, prevent, and respond effectively to terrorist activity. Goal 3: Violent extremist radicalization, recruitment, and inspiration to violence is diminished. FBS Objective 3.2: Build the capacity of partner government entities, civil society groups, and community leaders to counter violent extremism across the lifecycle of radicalization. Funding Information Total Available Funding: Up to $1,497,975 Award Amounts: Up to $1,497,975 Length of Performance Period: 24-36 Months Program Outcomes Outcome 1: Enable the Government of Tajikistan to build relationships and strengthen access to key stakeholders at the community-level to advance detection and response to terrorism at the source of activity, thus mitigating terrorist influence and interdicting terrorist activity. Sub-Outcome: Via an inception phase, identify pilot location(s) and key stakeholders and map current security plans at the local level. Outcome 2: Strengthen Remote Tajik localities skills to detect, report, and respond to illicit activity and/or early warning signs of radicalization. Sub-Outcome: Improve communication, cooperation, trust, and coordination on accessible tools for information sharing and incident response. Sub-Outcome: Strengthen detection and coordination capabilities within communities and between communities and appropriate security actors. Outcome 3: Trained personnel are prepared to respond to security crises within their remit.

The goals of the program are to serve as a catalyst for people to see and think about historic places differently; to create avenues for deep engagement with the arts in neighbourhoods, with a focus on those outside the downtown core; to create new audiences for artists and for museums and historic sites; and to address the growing need for access to space for the arts. This program envisions historic sites as vital public spaces of social interaction, where the past provides creative context for the future. What does this program support? The Animating Historic Sites program provides funding to professional artists, arts organizations and collectives working in any artistic discipline (i.e.: theatre, dance, music, visual arts, media arts, community engaged arts, Indigenous arts, Black arts, disability arts, arts education, literary arts, etc.) to pursue time limited projects involving site-specific research, development, creation, production, presentation, and programming that responds to or interprets the selected site or museum. Grant recipients will have the opportunity to conduct artistic research; explore the site and its exhibits, archives, surrounding landscape, historical and environmental context; engage with the local community; and present new site-responsive work in collaboration with the site or museum. The recipients will deliver free site-specific programming following research and development, which may vary in scope depending on the project. Programming may include activities such as: exhibitions, installations, performances, concerts, screenings, readings, workshops, presentations of work in progress, community-engaged arts activities, and other arts programming. Permanent exhibitions and installations are not eligible. All funded projects will be produced by the grant recipient and hosted and supported by the partnering site. Funding Information The maximum grant amount is $30,000. Eligibility Criteria This grant program is open to professional artists, not-for-profit arts organizations or artist collectives operating on a not-for-profit basis. A professional artist is someone who has developed their skills through training and/or practice; is recognized as such by artists working in the same artistic field; actively practices their art; seeks payment for their work; and has a history of public presentation. TAC recognizes that due to systemic barriers within the broader arts community (e.g., limited mainstream presentation opportunities for artists from equity-seeking communities) some flexibility may be required in interpreting eligibility criteria to take into account equivalent professional experience and contexts. Potential applicants from equity-seeking communities are encouraged to discuss their eligibility with the Program Manager in advance of applying.

Do you believe in learning by doing? This is your chance to make a lasting impact! The Orange Foundation is proud to announce its new Call for Projects: Learning Differently, designed to support associations working with young people in difficulty. This initiative empowers youth through active, hands-on learning using digital technology and collective projects to develop crucial transversal skills like communication, creativity, and critical thinking. The Learning Differently call for projects is intended for organizations that work to educate young people in need and help them get back on track. They want to support collaborative projects that incorporate active pedagogy and “learning by doing” to address the needs of the local community. This call for projects offers the opportunity to develop a group project led by young school dropouts and job seekers that addresses a local need and delivers a tangible solution. The project will enable these young participants to develop cross-disciplinary skills, i.e., the four Cs of education: collaboration, creativity, communication, and critical thinking. It will also help them break down barriers, regain self-confidence, rekindle their motivation, showcase their talents, and contribute to society. Duration The project takes place over one year. Eligibility Criteria Through innovative practices based on active pedagogy and learning by doing together, participants complete a group project (lasting a minimum of 35 hours). This fosters self-confidence, motivation, re-engagement, social connections, and skill development . The project addresses a local need relevant to the organization itself, another organization, a community, a company, or a societal issue. It fosters interaction with local stakeholders and is meaningful. An operational partnership must be established with the entity (organization, local authority, or company) whose needs are being addressed. This entity will validate the specifications, facilitate iterations during the project, and attend the presentation. Preference will be given to projects meeting an external request. The project delivers a useful concrete solution that meets the need. The project leverages digital technology (digital machines (FabLab), software, social networks, etc.) and raises awareness about responsible use of digital technology. The project is aimed at disadvantaged young people between the ages of 13 and 25. It is carried out in partnership with organizations that directly support these young people. If you do not directly support the young people, a referral partner is required (e.g., a second chance school, an organization that supports young people in difficulty, an organization for young refugees, a cultural organization, etc.) that will support them during and after the project to promote this experience and the skills they have developed. The young people will present the solutions they create in front of the partners, which will enable them to continue to develop their skills and take pride in what they have created. The required budget (these actions must be free for participants) should be realistic and not cover general operating costs or the wages of permanent staff. The Orange Foundation’s financial support will be used for the following: developing the project and coordination with partner organization(s) supporting the young people during the project and promoting the initiative purchasing materials needed to carry out the project, if necessary The ability to successfully carry out the project (team, skills another financial partner, etc.), the planned number of sessions/groups and the number of beneficiaries.

This … [Read more...] about UNICEF Jordan Supported Young People Mental Health and Wellbeing Programme","Deadline: 13-Jul-25 The United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in Jordan, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Youth, is inviting applications to support a new program focused on promoting mental health and wellbeing among young people. This initiative falls under UNICEF’s broader Adolescents Development and Participation (ADAP) program, which is dedicated to equipping adolescents and youth in Jordan with the skills and opportunities needed to grow into resilient and productive adults. The mental health program seeks to address the pressing emotional and psychological challenges that young people in the country face today. For many youth in Jordan, mental health is shaped by a web of social relationships and situational pressures. Worries about the present and uncertainty about the future often weigh heavily on their emotional state. Insights gathered from focus groups and interviews with young people, caregivers, and mental health professionals reveal that many adolescents experience feelings of fear and shame that prevent them from speaking openly about their struggles. These feelings also discourage them from seeking support, whether from peers or professional mental health services, further deepening the issue of stigma. The program aims to increase mental health literacy and support systems through a series of targeted activities. One key component involves building the capacity of professionals and frontline workers, particularly those in the Ministry of Youth and Ministry of Health, as well as young people actively engaged in mental health advocacy. This will be achieved through six workshops designed to train 150 participants, equipping them with the skills necessary to better support youth mental health needs. Access to mental health education will be expanded by embedding mental health literacy resources into 60 youth and health centers across Jordan. These centers will act as consistent sources of mental health knowledge, helping young people develop a more informed and supportive understanding of emotional well-being. To further normalize mental health discussions and reduce stigma, the program will establish safe, open spaces within community-based centers—including UNICEF youth centers in refugee camps and Ministry of Youth facilities. These spaces will be designed to engage 3,000 young people aged 16 to 24 in open, inclusive conversations around mental health, while also involving their parents and caregivers in the process. In an effort to drive innovation, the program will empower 2,100 young individuals to create youth-friendly digital content and campaigns. These young participants will design multimedia materials, launch social media initiatives, and explore artificial intelligence-based solutions as part of a mental health innovation challenge. By tapping into their creativity and lived experiences, the program hopes to generate relevant, relatable tools that can resonate with their peers and broaden the impact of the initiative. To measure the effectiveness of these interventions, an impact study will be conducted. This evaluation will assess the shifts in knowledge, attitudes, and practices among both professionals and young people regarding mental health and well-being. Through these efforts, UNICEF and its partners aim not only to improve access to mental health resources but also to foster a culture of openness, empathy, and support for Jordan’s youth.

Specifically, the programme calls for research into the possible choices for (spatial) planning of the river system, the effects of these choices and how river functions relate to each other within those choices. It is important to consider the whole system of the river basin, the socio-economic effects of policy choices and the role of waterborne transport. Goal The goal of this programme is to provide perspectives for potential policy choices concerning the large Dutch rivers. Research financed by this program should investigate the impact which various policy choices might have and how river functions may play into these choices. As such this programme aims to contribute to possible answers to the question of how the Netherlands can best prepare itself for future challenges concerning river systems. These challenges concern the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and larger changes in river water levels and quality. In addition, aspects concerning the whole system of the river basin, the socio-economic effects of policy choices and the role of waterborne transport play a significant role. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is the initiator of this call, supported by Rijkswaterstaat. Funding Information Within this Call for proposals one project can be funded. A total of € 2.880.000 is available. Eligibility Criteria There are four categories of participants within a consortium: Main applicant; Co-applicant(s); Cooperation partner(s); Co-funder(s) (optional). The organisation must: be established in the Netherlands; be a foundation, association or legal entity governed by public law; principally and independently engage in basic research, industrial research or experimental development ; be able to state that the organisation keeps separate accounts with regard to economic/noneconomic activities and that undertakings with decisive influence on the organisation do not enjoy preferential access to the organisation’s results.
